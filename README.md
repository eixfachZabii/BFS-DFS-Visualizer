# BFS and DFS Binary Tree Visualization

This repository provides a tool for visualizing BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) on a binary tree using Python. The visualization is done using networkx and matplotlib libraries.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bfs-dfs-binary-tree.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd bfs-dfs-binary-tree
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python bfs_dfs_binary_tree.py
   ```

5. **Follow the instructions on the terminal to see the visualization.**

## About the Code

The provided Python script `bfs_dfs_binary_tree.py` creates a binary tree with 20 nodes and performs BFS and DFS traversals on it. The tree visualization is done using networkx and matplotlib.

## Note

This tool is currently a basic helper and only supports binary trees. Contributions to extend its functionality to support other types of trees or additional algorithms are welcome!
